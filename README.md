## 🚨 The Problem

With the rapid rise of generative AI tools, it's now alarmingly easy to **clone someone’s voice**. Synthetic voice models can replicate tone, pitch, cadence, and emotion — making it nearly impossible to distinguish between **real human speech** and **AI-generated deepfake audio** with the naked ear.

This poses serious risks across multiple industries:

* **Cybersecurity**: Voice phishing and impersonation-based fraud
* **Finance**: Deepfake voices bypassing biometric authentication
* **Media**: Fake audio clips used to spread misinformation
* **Legal**: Audio evidence being manipulated or entirely fabricated

**There is an urgent need** for an intelligent, fast, and accurate solution that can detect whether an audio file is genuine or fake.

## 💡 The Solution — DeepFace Voice Detection

**DeepFace Voice Detection** is a machine learning-based tool designed to **differentiate between authentic and AI-generated voice recordings** with high accuracy.

### 🔍 How it Works

This project leverages:

* **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** for feature extraction — the gold standard in speech processing.
* **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** for classification — chosen for its robustness on smaller, well-separated datasets.
* Benchmarked against the **Fake-or-Real** dataset, which includes various text-to-speech generated audio types.

The model is capable of:

* Processing short audio clips (as little as 2 seconds)
* Delivering accurate predictions in seconds
* Being integrated into lightweight pipelines for real-time detection

## 📈 Results & Performance

Based on experiments:

* **SVM** performed best on short-duration audio sets (`for-rece`, `for-2-sec`)
* **Gradient Boosting** excelled in scenarios with normalized longer samples
* **VGG-16** deep learning architecture showed superior performance on full-length, original-quality audio clips

These results indicate that the choice of model can be optimized based on specific audio quality and use-case requirements.
